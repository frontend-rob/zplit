        <span class="article-text">
            This app uses Firebase Authentication to securely manage user logins and Firebase Firestore to store
            messages and user data. Both services are provided by Google and follow strong security standards, including
            encryption at rest and in transit. Access to data is controlled via Firebase Security Rules, allowing
            only authenticated users to access the data. While this is a non-commercial project, best
            practices in data handling and security are applied where possible.
