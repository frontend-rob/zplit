            This project collects limited personal data to support the basic functionality of the platform. This may
            include your name, email address, profile details, and any messages or files you choose to share while
            using the app. The data is used solely for the following purposes:
            <ul>
                <li>Enabling user accounts and login</li>
                <li>Group expenses and bill splitting</li>
                <li>Maintaining usability and stability</li>

            Personal data is never sold or shared with third parties and is only used within the scope of this
            project. All data is handled with care and used only within the context of this project. Since this is a
            non-commercial and educational project, data handling is kept to a minimum.

        <span class="article-text">
            This app uses Firebase Authentication to securely manage user logins and Firebase Firestore to store
            messages and user data. Both services are provided by Google and follow strong security standards, including
            encryption at rest and in transit. Access to data is controlled via Firebase Security Rules, allowing
            only authenticated users to access the data. While this is a non-commercial project, best
            practices in data handling and security are applied where possible.
